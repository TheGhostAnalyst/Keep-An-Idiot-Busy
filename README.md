# Keep an Idiot Busy

A playful Python script that humorously keeps the user “busy” with a silly counting task.

---

## Overview

This interactive program repeatedly asks the user if they want to know how to keep an idiot busy for hours. If the user says yes, it starts a slow counting task to keep them occupied. The program exits politely when the user says no.

---

## Features

- Asks a yes/no question using PyInputPlus for reliable input.
- If the answer is "yes", counts slowly from 1 to 10 with pauses to drag out the time.
- Prints a funny message at the end of the task.
- Allows the user to exit gracefully by saying "no".

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pyinputplus
